# TOOL-06 Tools should output raw data

The community generally agrees that tools should output raw data. That is, their output should be manipulated as little as possible. If a tool retrieves information represented in bytes, it should output bytes, rather than converting that value to another unit of measure. Having a tool output less-manipulated data helps the tool remain reusable in a larger number of situations.
