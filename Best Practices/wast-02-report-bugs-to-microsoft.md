# WAST-02 Report bugs to Microsoft

An exception: if you know that a built-in technique doesn't work properly (e.g., it is buggy or doesn't accomplish the exact task), then obviously it's fine to re-invent the wheel. However, in cases where you're doing so to avoid a bug or design flaw, then you should - as an upstanding member of the community - report the bug on Connect.Microsoft.com also.
