# DOC-05 Keep your language simple
Comment-based help should be written in simple language.

You're not writing a thesis for your college Technical Writing class - you're writing something that describes how a function works. Avoid grandiloquent, multisyllabic verbiage and phrasing. In other words, put the thesaurus down. You're not impressing anyone.

If you're writing in what is, for you, a foreign language, simpler words and simpler sentence structures are better, and more likely to make sense to a native reader.

Be complete, but be concise.
